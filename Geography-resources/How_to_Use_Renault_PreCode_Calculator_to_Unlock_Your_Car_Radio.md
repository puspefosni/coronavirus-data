## What is a Renault Pre-Code Calculator?
 
A Renault pre-code calculator is a software tool that can generate the radio code from the pre-code number that is displayed on your radio screen. The radio code is a four-digit number that is required to activate your car radio after a battery disconnect or a radio reset. The pre-code number is a letter followed by three digits that is shown on your radio screen when you press and hold buttons 1 and 6 or 1 and 5 (depending on your radio model).
 
A Renault pre-code calculator can help you to unlock your car radio without having to contact the dealer or pay for a service. You can download a Renault pre-code calculator online for free or use an online version on some websites. However, you should be careful when downloading or using any software from unknown sources, as they may contain viruses or malware that can harm your computer or device.
 
## How to Find Your Pre-Code Number?
 
To find your pre-code number, you need to access your radio screen. Depending on your radio model, you may need to remove the radio from the dashboard or use a special tool to access the screen. Here are some steps to follow:
 
- Turn on your car ignition and switch on your radio.
- Press and hold buttons 1 and 6 or 1 and 5 (depending on your radio model) until the pre-code number appears on the screen.
- Note down the pre-code number. It should be a letter followed by three digits, such as A123.
- If the pre-code number does not appear on the screen, you may need to remove the radio from the dashboard using a special tool or a flat screwdriver. Be careful not to damage the radio or the dashboard.
- Once you have removed the radio, look for a sticker on the side or back of the radio that has a barcode and a serial number.
- The pre-code number is usually the last four characters of the serial number. For example, if the serial number is RN481FX9180758, then the pre-code number is X918.
